# AStarDotNet
AStarDotNet is a generic and (hopefully) efficient pathfinder for C#/.NET. It uses an simple interface to enable it to operate on a wide variety of data structures. An example for a basic 2D tilemap is included, but it should be able to pathfind across any navigable structure, if the interface is implemented.
